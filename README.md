# CLEARNING - C Learning Projects Collection

CLEARNING is a collection of learning projects developed in pure C language. This project demonstrates C programming concepts, including file handling, text analysis, console user interfaces, and basic data structures.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

### Main Projects

- **[CL](projects/cl/README.md)**: A command-line tool launcher that allows executing different utilities.
- **[HUB](projects/hub/README.md)**: A simple menu interface to access available tools.
- **[CXT](projects/cxt/README.md)**: A text analysis tool that counts words, frequencies, and generates reports.

### Common Library

- **[Common](common/)**: Static library providing shared utilities like map structures and console screen management.

## System Requirements

- **C Compiler**: GCC (MinGW recommended on Windows) or C11 compatible.
- **CMake**: Version 3.10 or higher for project building.
- **Ninja**: Optional but recommended build generator.
- **Operating System**: Windows compatible (tested on Windows with MinGW).

## Building and Installation

1. **Clone or download** the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the project root directory**:
   ```bash
   cd d:\Programacion\CLearning
   ```

3. **Configure with CMake**:
   ```bash
   cmake -G Ninja .
   ```
   Or if you prefer Makefiles:
   ```bash
   cmake .
   ```

4. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   ninja
   ```
   Or with make:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

This will generate the executables in the corresponding directories:
- `build/cl.exe`
- `build/hub.exe`
- `build/cxt.exe`

## Usage

### Run CL (Main Launcher)
```bash
./build/cl.exe --help
```

### Run HUB (Menu Interface)
```bash
./build/hub.exe
```

### Run CXT directly
```bash
./build/cxt.exe
```

For detailed command reference, see [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Dependencies

- **Standard C Libraries**: All dependencies are part of the C standard library.
- **Windows-specific Functions**: The project uses some Windows API functions for console operations (like `system("cls")`).

## Contributing
