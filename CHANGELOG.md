# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to a comnination of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org). Using the same principles as SemVer but changing minor updates to weekly (can be exceptions) drops of content.

  - ExistKey() function for key existence check
  - ExistValue() function for value existence check
- Screen management utilities:

- Windows compatibility focus

### Technical Details
- Pure C implementation without external dependencies
- Standard C library usage only
- Windows API integration for console operations
- Dynamic memory allocation for data structures
- File I/O operations for text analysis and report management
- Command-line interface design
- Modular code architecture with separate header files

### Documentation
- Main project README with build and usage instructions
- Component-specific README files (CL, HUB, CXT, Common)
- Feature descriptions and API documentation
- Build system configuration details
- Dependency and compatibility information
- Comprehensive command reference (DOCUMENTATION.md)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-05

### Chages and additions

### Common Library
- File finder implementation started:
  - For now, due to this being just a pre-realease, its just the functions I need right now.

### Hotfixes
- Installer missing folders added
- Setup for CBA development implemented

### Documentation
- Diary added for day by day thoughts during development.
- Roadmap addded for future plans

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-06
### Changes and additions
### Common library
- File finder updated:
  - lookForRootFiles() and ListDirectories() added for easier file management  

### Added
- **CBA entered beta:**
  - **Auto CMakelists.txt:** CBA automatically detects every folder and for c files, adding them to their own CMakelists and implementing it all into a main CMakelists.txt file.
  - **Library support:** Wanna code your own libraries for your C projects? add them to /common or /libraries and let CBA do the rest.
  - **Default settings:** When CBA can't find a cba.build file it'll use cba.config to make one from scratch, you can't modify it for now, stay tuned for next update ;D  
(For now, it's only compatible with C projects and a specific project structure, check [cba.md](./projects/cba/README.md) for more detailed information.)

### Technical Details
- CBA **WILL NOT WORK** if you don't have CMake and Ninja versions (min ver in [cba.md](./projects/cba/README.md))  
### Hotfixes
- Installer missing files added
- Added .config files, useless for the moment.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-09
### Documentation
- Fixed ALL README.md files
- Updated CHANGELOG.md
- Remade [cba.md](./projects/cba/README.md)
- Usual DIARY.md entries  
- Made some hotfixes

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-10
### Author
- Developed by Nahum Naranjo as a C learning project
