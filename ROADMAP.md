# Roadmap :D

For future realeases I'm planning to add:  
2. **CL Package Manager**: It's kinda hard to do and I know it (have no idea) but I think I'll be alright. Basically, I want to add the typical "cl install \[package\]" so you can install CL and then just add a specific library to your project root instead of doing it by hand. For example, CMap would work really well with this, i had headahces trying to add it to chocolatey (gave up about five minutes later when I decided to do one on my own).  
3. **CMNGR (C Configuration Manager)**: Basically, another CL DLC to configure all the project's libraries in one central configuration. I'm thinking of having configuration files, something like "cxt.cconfig" (intentional double c) or so, it won't be that necessary but it'll be fun to code.  
4. **CUTEST (C Unit Test and yeah, like "most" cute)**: Basically, just another tool for doing tests just like CUnit or Check. I don't really know what will I do here but (I hope) it'll be fun tho  
5. **CFM (C File Manager)**: Another DLC for cl.c (I think it's my favorite part of the project), this one will be just as good as windows built-in file manager (Just joking, obviusly better). I'm planning to do it for maybe the 2.0.0 or so, it's a bigger project than it seems.  
6. **CDOCGEN (C Document Generator)**: Just a garbage file generator, maybe you wanna make a 3 gb file worth of pure chaos, just like a very long keybord smash,
