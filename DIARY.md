# Dev Diary :D  
## Introduction
Here, I'll narrate every single problem/curious thing that happened during the development of this project, just so I can read it and laugh at myself in the future (I hope near future D:).  

## 1.0.0 realease  
I actually never really worked with all these new tools before (Inno setup, C itself, cmake, etc...) but i really enjoyed the experience, it was very challenging to learn a new coding language (And specially if it is C) with a project instead of a class but it was rewarding. One of the biggest challenges I had during the development of this project (specially cxt) was learning about pointers and strings with c, it might be one of the hardest things to dominate out there, if it wasn't because of google this project might be dead, I can't imagine how people used to code without the beauty of learning through a search engine.  

## 1.1.0 realease
Hello there! it's the first time I write it from the beginning of the period of time I'm supposed to be doing it, so, let's start with the first few things I would like to present you the only thing I wanna add in this realease.  
- **Build Assistant**: I know its hard to do but I would like to code an automatic cmake file generator to just code and code without worrying for the cmake :D. I guess I'll just have a basic template for its first version and then add a bunch more of them. I'm thinking of some commands like:  
```bash
    # This one would make the cbaFile.cl so the user can just do build or cl -ba build to update
    [buildSystem] -[assembler] # This would go in cba.c
    cl -ba cmake -ninja # This one would use CL PATH command as a short cut
    # ↑ uses cmake and ninja as examples

    build # On cba.c would update the CMake files and  build the .exe
    reset # Deletes all cbaFiles.cl so you can change configurations
    config # configuration menu
```
Anyways, I'll put them in the documentation once I finish it. For the moment, those are the only ones I have planned so far.

### 1.0.1 update :D
For this update (which I have about half an hour to code) I'll try to set the base for this new tool in the stack, wish me luck!

For the first files I made, I must say, I really should work on ui.c, it reapeats in every new project that needs it, I know it's hard to make an universal one. Was thinking about C#'s override feature but discarded it after noticing it'd be the same, I'd override it literally ALL the times I wanna make a personalized UI so I'll keep doing it the way I'm doing so until I come up with a better plan.

As I kept working I found out the past bash commands were not good enough, they were pretty repetitive and complicated for things I could automate and make easier for the user so this is the idea now:  
```bash
    build # Will look for cba.build, with all the info it needs to run
    prepare # If it doesn't find said file, you should run this one
    config # Pretty much self-explanatory
```
If build is run without a cba.build file it'll ask the user for permission to make another one, assuming its the root directory of the project and writing with the options saved in cba directory in C:/InCGames/CL/configs

---

Another minor patch for the installer. For now, it's just a minor adjustment on what files and where does it make it. Before, the config files weren't generated at all (wasn't necessary), now they're located at "C:\InCGames\cl\configs" on the user's pc. 

Also, I found out I left cba.c incomplete last time I touched it, started to work in that

I honestly thought it'd be harder, ofc it's way simpler than i want it to be and i haven't tested a thing but i'm pretty sure it'll work just fine, for now, CBA is half way to it's first usable release (which will be 1.1.0 of the main program). For now, when you first run the build command, it starts doing magic, looking for a cba.build file (if it doesn't, it'll look for cba.config in the same folder as the last time i said it). then, it'll write this code to the main CMakelists.txt

```cmake
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION %s) // %s is the variable that
    project(%s VERSION %s)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)
    set(CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM ninja)
    file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES CONFIGURE_DEPENDS "*.c")
    file(GLOB_RECURSE HEADERS CONFIGURE_DEPENDS "*.h")
    add_executable(%s ${SOURCES} ${HEADERS})
    set_target_libraries(%s PRIVATE common)
```

then, it'll look for subdirectories, making a basic CMakelists.txt for each one, being:
```cmake
    file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES CONFIGURE_DEPENDS "*.c")
    file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES CONFIGURE_DEPENDS "*.h")
    target_sources(%s PRIVATE ${SOURCES} ${HEADERS})
    set_target_libraries(%s PRIVATE common)
```

if the subdirectory name is:
- ".cbaignore"
- "tests"
- "docs"
- "configs"
- ".idea"
- ".github"
- ".vscode"
- ".git"
- "build"

it'll automatically ignore it  
if the directory name is "common", then cba will make this CMakelists.txt:
```cmake
    file(GLOB COMMON_SOURCES "common/*.c")
    add_library(common STATIC ${COMMON_SOURCES})
    target_include_directories(common PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
    set_target_properties(common PROPERTIES C_STANDARD 11)
```

And that's it, now the user should be able to run either "ninja", "cmake .." or "cba build" (prefirably cba build because it rechecks everything) to get the .exe's

For now and due to my lack of experience with cmake, it'll be based completely on my files so it won't have that much of compatibility but it'll improve with time. This was an easy tool to develop tbh, I was hoping to find problems.

## 1.2.0
(yeah, i forgot last realease was 1.1 and put a 1.2 the whole time)  
For this version i want to:
- **Refactor CBA** due to some issues i saw during the weekend on folder checking and adding it's documentation and changelog
- Finally work with **CL and do a major overhaul** of it's functionalities
- Take **CBA out of beta** and add it to the hub so it has an easier access
- Finally use **.config files** added in last update.

Also, i'm gonna change the format of this markdown file, now it'll have different sections for the different plans for the minor realease and other sections for patches or updates.  
Last format was way too chaotic.  
**(After afinating)**
I came to this new versioning protocol. I upload a daily patch and a weekly drop of a new tool (this one being cba) so the new versioning will be:  
major.weeklyDrop.dailyPatch (so don't be surprised if we're in 1.39.4 in a near future)

Another anouncement, i'm trying to add a new tool/minor update each week so stay tuned!

### CBA refactorization  
I'm tired today so let's work with this, it's way simpler and easier so i hope i finish quick. After a quick check on the code, i noticed i could let the user build their own structure and have some defaults instead of directly doing it all by myself.  

For now, I've been working more on the interpreter than actual refactoring the code, all it's flaws are perfectly corregible by just doing a good work with the interpreter and cl. For now, im pretty sure it's gonna be easy.  

I've been learning a lot these few weeks i've had this project, fr i think c is the greatest language to ever exist, i can do whatever i want however i want and the computer will do exactly that, almost no rules, almost nothing to do but code and learn a lot, specially when it comes to string functions, coming from high level languages it's way different but way funnier this way (and more efficient, i guess). Also, memory managment is not that bad as people say, it's like dude, just keep track of what you're doing and that's it. I wanna be a C programmer (embedded engineering calling) someday.  


### CL Overhaul
It's already late today so i'm gonna try to rush it, even though it's wednesday, i might be a bit short on time already. Curious thing of the day, my family calls me alex beacause it's my middle name but every other person calls me nahum, a bit useless today but it's better than nothing.

### Doc works
For today (09/02/26), I'll be working on this, changelog, roadmap and all project md's must be outdated and kinda weird because i wrote them in a rush. Also, curious thing of the day, linux had over 10 thousand lines of code, 5.9k of ANSI C, 2.5k of C headers and 1.4k lines of i386 assembler (goated cpu btw).

To start the day, I read a [github article](https://github.com/resources/articles/tools-and-techniques-for-effective-code-documentation), it wasn't that useful tbh.

As i worked in the documentation (not much of a deal, it's the boring part) i noticed i haven't been updating the installer in a while, i just runned "iscc [filepath]" and didn't notice i still had to run "ninja" on my project so all versions before 1.1.0 are the exact same 1.0.0. Also, i had a few problems with lookForRootFiles.c and cba.c so i fixed them, nothing much, just design problems. I assumed i'd always need to normally read the file but now i know i didn't, prepare uses "rb" and build uses "r" so I just added a new param to lookForRootFiles() so i can just stick it into the fopen().   

I honestly didn't what to write to the ROADMAP.md so i just started to imagine the whole project and write it down, maybe that's how it words. It might be it, i think im done for today, its 6 o'clock and im hungry, see ya later! (it's been 3 hours of work now D:)

## 1.1 minor updates/patches
